# Case study

In this work Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm DGEMO is used to predict the properties of material (SS 316L) based on proccess oonditions and suggest next set of parameters that would produce denser and harder sample. 

The metalic samples were printed in laboratory of additive manufactruing in Skoltech, Moscow. Each sample has unique set of process conditions that resulted in different hardness and porosity. The goal of the algorithm is to map process conditions and mechanical properties of fabricated mattalic part
